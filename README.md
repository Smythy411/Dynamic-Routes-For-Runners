# Project Abstract
There are many applications that will map a runner’s route as it is being traversed, but not many for generating a custom runningroute for the user. This can be desirable for users who may wish to return to their starting point at the end of the run, or control the distance of the route. This is especially true if the user is unfamiliar with the local environment.The goal of this project is to research and develop an Android application capable of mapping a personalised running route, utilising Open Street Maps (OSM)and geolocation. This project will allow the user to create an optimal generated route from their location, or any location they input. The user will be able to tailor this route to their own preferences, such as if it’s a 5k or 10k.The route that is being generated should satisfy the conditions laid out in the chapter ‘Description of Solution’
